## Installation and Execution

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system. You can check if Node.js is installed by running:

```bash
node -v
```

This should show the version of Node.js installed. If it is not installed, download it from the [official site](https://nodejs.org/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The minimum Node.js version required is **22.18.0**, since type stripping is enabled by default, which is required because the project runs TypeScript files directly with Node.

To run this project on your local machine, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaimejaramilloperez/adventjs-2025.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd adventjs-2025
```

3. Install the dependencies (optional) using the package manager of your choice (npm, pnpm, etc).

```bash
npm install
```

4. Run all tests with:

```bash
npm run challenges
```

Or run the tests for each challenge with the following command, replacing `{challenge number}` with the corresponding number:

```bash
npm run challenge{challenge number}
```

For example:

```bash
npm run challenge1 # Runs tests for challenge 1
npm run challenge5 # Runs tests for challenge 5
npm run challenge12 # Runs tests for challenge 12
npm run challenge25 # Runs tests for challenge 25
```
